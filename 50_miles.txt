an infectious agent depends on a reservoir for its survival
flame-retardant
the valley of the Rhone is famous for its vineyards
a mere ribbon of land
the lighted ribbon of traffic
from the air the road was a grey thread
a thread of smoke climbed upward
the sun shone through a rift in the clouds
there was a rip in his pants
she had snags in her stockings
the river was navigable for 50 miles
he threw a rock at me
the roof of the cave was very high
I could see the roof of the bear's mouth
the story is going the rounds in Washington
a mackerel sky filled with rows of clouds
rows of barbed wire protected the trenches
Theodore Roosevelt and his Rough Riders became famous for their charge up San Juan Hill
they collected blood scrapings for analysis
sections from the left ventricle showed diseased tissue
