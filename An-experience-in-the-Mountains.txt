the chairs were arranged in a circle
the moon's disk hung in a cloudless sky
a ring of ships in the harbor
a halo of smoke
the shape of the DNA molecule is a double helix
the tendrils of the plant exhibited perversion
perversion also shows up in kinky telephone cords
a circle is an ellipse with zero eccentricity
the sums of the distances from the foci to any point on an ellipse is constant
you can compute the area of a square if you know the length of its sides
the coastline of Chile and Argentina and Brazil forms two legs of a triangle
parallels never meet
the flowchart contained many boxes
he hated the sinuosity of mountain roads
they built a tree house in the tortuosities of its boughs
the acrobat performed incredible contortions
their muscles stood out in knots
the old man's fists were two great gnarls
his stomach was in knots
there was a jog in the road
