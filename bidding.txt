the newly elected congressmen rejected a compromise because they considered it `business as usual'
the ratification of the treaty
confirmation of the appointment
do I hear a second?
he had a dispute with his wife
there were irreconcilable differences
the familiar conflict between Republicans and Democrats
the incident triggered a political firestorm
a collision of interests
they were involved in a violent argument
they had a quarrel
they had words
a violent fight over the bill is expected in the Senate
a generous offer of assistance
the notification stated the grace period and the penalties for defaulting
I could tell that it was his wish that the guests leave
his crying was an indirect request for attention
an invitation to lunch
she threw the invitation away
they came at his bidding
