she gave it a good try
they made a futile play for power
he made a bid to gain attention
he took a crack at it
I gave it a whirl
scientists' forays into politics
I am proud of my contribution in advancing the project
they all did their share of the work
he held up his end
she worked for women's liberation
she laughed at this sexual power play and walked away
he gave it his best shot
he took a stab at forecasting
getting through the crowd was a real struggle
he fought a battle for recognition
in the experimental trials the amount of carbon was measured separately
he called each flip of the coin a new trial
he survived the great test of battle
candidates must compete in a trial of skill
they funded a pilot project in six states
