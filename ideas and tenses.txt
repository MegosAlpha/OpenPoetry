he admired the inclusion of so many ideas in such a short work
the relatedness of all living things
those issues have no bearing on our situation
`Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer' is an example of apposition
`The boy threw the ball' uses the active voice
`The ball was thrown by the boy' uses the passive voice
`The ball was thrown' is an abbreviated passive
`I have finished' is an example of the present perfect
`I had finished' is an example of the past perfect
`I had been running' is an example of the past progressive
`I will have finished' is an example of the future perfect
`I will be running' is an example of the future progressive
he wanted to feel a part of something bigger than himself
I read a portion of the manuscript
the smaller component is hard to reach
the animal constituent of plankton
the basis of this drink is orange juice
it was perfect in all details
the highlight of the tour was our visit to the Vatican
the reduced the number of units and installations
