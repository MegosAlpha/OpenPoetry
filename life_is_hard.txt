have the mopes
they took drugs to get a high on
I'm on a permanent high these days
panic in the stock market
a war scare
a bomb scare led them to evacuate the building
he had a fit
she threw a tantrum
he made a scene
having to stand in line so long was a real bummer
he was in a snit
grappling with financial difficulties
this problem is a real bitch
finds himself in a most awkward predicament
the woeful plight of homeless people
his lying got him into a tight corner
his views on race got him into political hot water
the pinch of the recession
he got into a terrible fix
he made a muddle of his marriage
