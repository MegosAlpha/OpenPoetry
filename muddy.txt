he recorded angular distances between the stars
the gun in his pocket made an obvious bulge
the hump of a camel
he stood on the rocky prominence
the occipital protuberance was well developed
the bony excrescence between its horns
the belly of a sail
the caput humeri is the head of the humerus which fits into a cavity in the scapula
he left the impression of his fingers in the soft mud
there are approximately 336 dimples on a golf ball
the Earth is an ellipsoid
the base of the triangle
it looked like a sphere but on closer examination I saw it was really a spheroid
a ball of fire
the test tube held a column of white powder
a tower of dust rose above the horizon
a thin pillar of smoke betrayed their campsite
a plume of smoke
grass with large plumes
a tall sandstone hoodoo
