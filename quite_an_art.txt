a schoolgirl fantasy
I have this pipe dream about being emperor of the universe
a man of resource
he dipped into his intellectual armory to find an answer
his testimony was a concoction
she has no peer in the concoction of mystery stories
his skillful contrivance of answers to every problem
the skill of a well-trained boxer
the sweet science of pugilism
he has a nose for good deals
in a final bravura the ballerina appeared to be floating in water
the music ends with a display of bravura
he wanted to try his hand at singing
the art of conversation
it's quite an art
he read a book on salesmanship but it didn't help
he can do any sort of work requiring handiness and dexterity
understanding affine transformations requires considerable mathematical sophistication
a good command of French
his quick adeptness was a product of good design
