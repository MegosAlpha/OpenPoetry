vigilance is especially susceptible to fatigue
cherish their official political freedom with fierce jealousy"-Paul Blanshard
with the exception of the children, everyone was told the news
he had a great feeling for music
Dubyuh has no sprachgefuhl
a man admired for the depth of his perception
it passed without remark
early detection can often lead to a cure
a sensation of touch
some people have much higher pain thresholds than do other people
he studied auditory masking by pure tones
the runners emerged from the trees into his clear vision
he had a visual sensation of intense light
she loved the smell of roses
incense filled the room
the candy left him with a bad taste
the melon had a delicious taste
the wine has a nutty flavor and a pleasant finish
it needed lemon juice to sharpen the flatness of the dried lentils
he strained to hear the faint sounds
