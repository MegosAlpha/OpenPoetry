they sat on the hearth and warmed themselves before the fire
the hell of battle
the inferno of the engine room
when you're alone Christmas is the pits
a dead drop avoids the need for an intelligence officer and a spy to be present at the same time
they stood on high and observed the countryside
he doesn't like heights
the sun set behind the brow of distant hills
his office was a hole-in-the-wall
the United States is the home of basketball
the United States cannot police all of the world's hot spots
in the belly of the ship
in the midst of the crowd
a bureaucracy...chiefly concerned with turf...and protecting the retirement system
he hit a jump shot from the top of the key
he dominates play in the paint
he took a long lead off first
they attacked the enemy's line
New York is a mecca for young artists
all points on the same meridian have the same longitude
